# Important Information !!!

I have deployed the frontend of this project on Vercel and the backend on Render. It's working fine, but when used only for the first time, it might take around 1 or half minutes initially. This delay is because it is deployed on Render, which causes the first-time startup delay. Otherwise, everything is working fine. In case any issue arises, there is a 0% chance of that happening. However, I have uploaded screenshots below for you to review.
